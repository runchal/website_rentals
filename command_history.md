# Command and Action Log

### Command from User (2025-06-17 05:22:02)
`pick up where you left off. after every command i give write it to a file so you have history of my commands and a summary of your changes`

### My Actions
1.  **Acknowledged New Workflow:** I will now log each user command and a summary of my corresponding actions into this file.
2.  **Resuming Task:** I am picking up where I left off: applying a `.container` class to all page sections to enforce a consistent maximum width, as defined in `style.css`.
3.  **Corrected Approach:** Instead of attempting to modify large chunks of the HTML file at once, I will proceed section by section to ensure accuracy and avoid errors.
