# ACTUAL Homepage Differences from Overlay Analysis

## From the Overlay Comparison:

### 1. **HERO SECTION**
- **Wireframe**: Much taller hero section with more vertical padding
- **Current**: Hero is too short/compressed
- **Fix**: Increase hero padding significantly

### 2. **SUGGESTED USE CASES**
- **Wireframe**: TINY cards in a single row, very minimal
- **Current**: HUGE cards in 2x2 grid taking up way too much space
- **Fix**: Make cards MUCH smaller, single row layout

### 3. **ACCESSORIES SECTION**
- **Wireframe**: Small simple cards
- **Current**: Cards are 3x bigger than they should be
- **Fix**: Dramatically reduce card size

### 4. **INDUSTRIES SECTION** 
- **Wireframe**: This appears to be 3 large promotional banners
- **Current**: Wrong section entirely - showing "Products" with wrong layout
- **Fix**: Replace with 3 promotional industry banners

### 5. **ADVANTAGES SECTION**
- **Wireframe**: Has an "Advantages" section with cards
- **Current**: Missing entirely
- **Fix**: Add this section

### 6. **24/7 SUPPORT SECTION**
- **Wireframe**: Has a support section
- **Current**: Missing
- **Fix**: Add this section

### 7. **TESTIMONIALS**
- **Wireframe**: Single centered testimonial
- **Current**: Correct but needs spacing adjustment

### 8. **TRUSTED BY**
- **Wireframe**: Simple logo row
- **Current**: Correct

### 9. **BOTTOM CTA**
- **Wireframe**: "Wherever, whenever..." section
- **Current**: Correct but text/spacing needs adjustment

### 10. **CONTACT SECTION**
- **Wireframe**: Simple contact info at bottom
- **Current**: Too elaborate, should be simpler

## SCALE IS COMPLETELY WRONG!
The wireframe is MUCH more compact with smaller elements throughout. My implementation has everything 2-3x larger than it should be.
