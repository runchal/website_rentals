# Homepage Wireframe vs Current Implementation Comparison

## CRITICAL DIFFERENCES - They Look NOTHING Alike!

### What the Wireframe ACTUALLY Shows:

1. **Hero Section**
   - Simple dark banner with text and ONE button
   - Text: "Batteries for every situation. Yeah, that one too."
   - Single "Start Shopping" button

2. **Suggested Use Cases Section**
   - Small cards with icons on LEFT side
   - 4 cards: Powering 🏠, Film Set 🎬, Construction 🏗️, Live Events 🎪
   - Each card has small icon + title only
   - NO descriptions in cards

3. **Categories Section** 
   - 4 simple cards in a 2x2 grid
   - Small cards with minimal content
   - Each has title + short description

4. **Products Section**
   - Shows what appears to be 3 PROMOTIONAL banners/cards
   - These are larger promotional blocks, NOT product cards
   - Left one is bigger than the two on the right

5. **Newsletter Section**
   - Simple centered newsletter signup

6. **Testimonial**
   - Single testimonial with stars

7. **Trusted By**
   - Logo section with company logos

8. **Bottom CTA**
   - "Wherever, whenever our batteries are, we are too."
   - Dark section with text and button

9. **Footer**
   - Standard footer with links

### What I Built (WRONG):

1. ✅ Hero - Correct
2. ✅ Suggested Use Cases - Layout is 2x2 but cards are too big
3. ✅ Categories - Layout is 2x2 but cards are too big  
4. ❌ Products - I built wrong cards, should be promotional banners
5. ✅ Newsletter - Correct
6. ✅ Testimonial - Correct
7. ✅ Trusted By - Correct
8. ✅ Bottom CTA - Correct
9. ❌ Contact Info section - This doesn't exist in wireframe!
10. ✅ Footer - Correct

## MAIN ISSUES:

1. **Card Sizes** - All my cards are WAY too big compared to wireframe
2. **Products Section** - Completely wrong, should be promotional banners not product cards
3. **Extra Contact Section** - Should be removed
4. **Overall Spacing** - Too much vertical space between sections
5. **Typography** - Section headings are too large
