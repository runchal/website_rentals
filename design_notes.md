# Design & Implementation Notes

This document tracks key design details from the wireframes and learnings from the implementation process to improve accuracy.

## Key Learnings & Process Changes

1.  **From User Feedback (2025-06-17):** The initial implementation was too generic. It followed the content blocks but missed key layout and interactive elements specified in the wireframe. The process must be more meticulous.
2.  **Correction:** Instead of building the entire page at once, I will now work section by section, taking a screenshot after each one and comparing it directly to the wireframe before moving on.
3.  **Lesson:** Command-line screenshotting is a powerful tool for self-correction. Use it after every significant change.

## `Homepage.png` - Detailed Breakdown

### Global

*   **Layout:** Content is centered with a clear `max-width`. The background appears to be white or a very light gray (#FFFFFF or #F7F7F7) for most sections, with the hero being a notable exception.
*   **Typography:** The font is a clean, modern sans-serif (Inter seems appropriate). Need to be precise about weights (headings vs. body text).

### Section-Specific Details

*   **Hero Section:** Dark background. Centered text. Single, prominent CTA button.
*   **Product/Accessory/Industry Sections:** These are **CAROUSELS**, not grids. They feature left/right navigation arrows. The products within should not wrap but scroll horizontally.
*   **Section Headers:** Use a `flex` layout with `justify-content: space-between` to place the title on the left and the "View All" link on the right.
*   **Advantages Section:** This is a custom grid, not a uniform one. The cards have different heights and the layout is staggered. This will require a specific CSS Grid or Flexbox configuration to achieve.
*   **"Trusted By" Logos:** These must be actual logos (SVGs preferred for scalability) and not text placeholders.
*   **Contact Section:** This is a distinct section *above* the footer, with horizontal dividers between each item.
*   **Footer:** Contains only the multi-column navigation links, below the contact section.

## Future Enhancements

*   **CSS Refactoring:** Consider refactoring the CSS to use a more modular approach (e.g., BEM) to improve maintainability, especially for shared components like buttons and cards.
*   **JavaScript Animations:** Add subtle animations (e.g., on-scroll fade-ins, hover effects) to make the site feel more dynamic and polished. This is outside the scope of the static wireframes.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Once the site is complete, implement performance best practices such as image optimization (e.g., using WebP), and CSS/JS minification.
